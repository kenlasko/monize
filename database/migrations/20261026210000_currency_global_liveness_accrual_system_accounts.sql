-- accrual_system_accounts holds a currency_code but was never added to the
-- two currency-liveness functions (migrations 136/137), so a currency used
-- only there could be reported as unreferenced -- and deactivated out from
-- under a schedule still using it -- and a user's per-currency accrual
-- balance would not travel with their backup export.
--
-- CREATE OR REPLACE is idempotent; the full bodies are restated verbatim
-- plus the one new branch each, matching database/schema.sql.
